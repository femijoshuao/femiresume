          ERPNext is one of the most impressive enterprise business applications on which I have ever worked. 
          Because it is a Phyton application and an open source project, its simplicity and community of talented developers 
          assist in promptly resolving issues.

          This project began as a way for me to understand the Frappe Framework and to assist my customer in moving to a 
          digital business solution in order to achieve their objectives. This has taught me a lot of useful skills, and I'm pleased to have it in my portfolio. 
          If you're looking for a cost-effective business application that can replace SAP or SAGE and includes manageable modules such as Accounting, 
          Invoicing, Inventory, Manufacturing, Sales, Human Resources, and more, go no further. I'll gladly help you set it up on any cloud service 
          provider of your choosing. I also provided a managed solution for small businesses.
